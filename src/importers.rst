Importers
=========

ActivityWatch can't track everything, so sometimes you might want to import data from another source.

- :gh-aw:`aw-import-ical`, supports importing from ``.ical`` files or syncing with Google Calendar.
- :gh-aw:`aw-importer-smartertime`, imports from `smartertime`_ (Android time tracker).
- :gh-aw:`aw-import-screentime`, attempt at importing from macOS's Screen Time (and potentially iOS through syncing)
- LastFM importer, :gh-user:`ErikBjare` has code for it somewhere, ask him if you're interested.
